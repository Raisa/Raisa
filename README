# Raisa

Raisa project aims to develop an autonomous vehicle based on [DFRobotshop Rover V2 XBee](http://www.robotshop.com/eu/dfrobotshop-rover-tracked-robot-xbee-kit-4.html) platform and lessons learned from the AI. The visualization and the AI is implemented in Java programming language.

AI algorithms that might be implemented:
* Localization (particle filter) 
* Path planning (A* search)
* Localization and mapping (SLAM)
* etc

Sensors that are used:
* Rangefinders (ultrasonic and infrared)
* Inertial measurement unit (gyroscope, magnometer, accelerometer)
* Sound sensors (in stereo)
* Encoders for reading wheel rotation
* Integrated light and temperature sensors

In the future, the vehicle will be supplied with arms (lasers and stuff). Beware!
